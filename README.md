# Cryptographic-Coins-Simulation
This project is a simulation of a cryptographic coin system based on UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output). The system implements basic blockchain operations, including creating wallets, making transactions, validating signatures, and managing a blockchain. The project is developed in Python and adheres to cryptographic principles.
